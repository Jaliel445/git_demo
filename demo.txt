The Russian-Ukranian war is descibed in the New Testament.
It says explicitly that when the 'Bear', or Russia, moves
into the south starting a war, the 'Dragon', or China, will 
meet up with the 'Bear', the 'Dragon' will utterly destroy
the 'Bear'. If Putin wants to quote scripture, he should this part as well,
to let his people know what their future holds for them
if they don't give up this war.
