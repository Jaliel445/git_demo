The Russian-Ukrainian war is the start of everything.
The Bibles New Testament explicitly says that the
'Bear' naming Russia and the 'Dragon' naming China,
will battle it out when the 'Bear' moves southword.
If Putin reads this part of the scripture, he'll
know he doesn't have a snowballs chance in hell
of winning his little war to reunite the old Russia.
 When China moves in for war, it will not be on Russia's side.
So, if I was Putin, I'd withdraw every soldier from the
Ukraine as fast as I could, because if he doesn't,
Russia will be wiped off the map by China and the coalition.
